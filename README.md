## Abstract

While the impact of COVID-19 on society has been widely studied, research on the social impact of the pandemic on orphans is limited. This may be due, in part, to the survey-based nature of studies involving orphanages, which were difficult to conduct during the pandemic. To address this gap, this study uses text mining tools to analyze Tweets related to 'orphans' during the early stages of the pandemic. By combining topic modeling with sentiment and emotion classification, we find that the number of 'orphans'-related Tweets containing the emotions of 'anger' and 'disgust' increased as the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic progressed in its early stages. These results were accompanied by topical concerns about vulnerability and the lack of resources or care provided to orphans during the early stages of the pandemic. These findings are crucial for understanding the social concerns of orphans during COVID-19 and can serve as a valuable resource for stakeholders seeking to address philanthropic insecurity in orphanages during future crises or pandemics. Additionally, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of using social media mining tools to examine various societal concerns during crises and pandemics.
