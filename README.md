Please Cite as: Lessons from #COVID-19 Tweets: Using social media mining to understand the preventable shortfalls in services to orphans in future crises

## Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed shortfalls in crisis readiness among governmental and non-governmental stakeholders targeted toward the service of institutionalized populations, such as orphans. As such, many public and private entities alike have sought to gather extensively surveyed lessons brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic to anticipate better preparations for future crises. However, literature concerning COVID-19's impact on shortfalls in aid to orphans among both public and private entities remains scarce. This can be primarily attributed to the survey-based nature of studies involving orphanages, which were difficult to conduct during the pandemic. This study aims to fill this gap by utilizing social media mining, which can be defined as analyzing user-generated content from social platforms to examine specific societal issues. In particular, text-mining tools were used to analyze COVID-19-related tweets associated with `orphans' during the early stages of the pandemic. By applying text-mining tools such as topic modeling, sentiment classification, and emotion classification to these tweets, this study was able to extract insightful and meaningful information on the social concerns and state of affairs concerning the care of orphans during the early stages of the pandemic. Our results show that as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed in its early stages, there were increased emotions of `anger' and `disgust', as well as topical concerns about the vulnerability of orphans and the lack of resources or care provided to orphanages. These results were used to promote recommendations aimed at improving service readiness to orphans during future crises.
